<h2> About me</h2>
<p> For the last 13 years, I have made Chicago my home. I currently reside in the Ravenswood neighborhood. The best parts of Chicago are: the food scene, the library network, and the plethora of opportunities for learning and adventure. </p>

<h3> Career Interests </h3>

I have experience leading both front end and back end development teams as well as plenty of cross functional team coordination. Stakeholder managment is one of my strengths and interacting with users is my favorite part of the role. </p>
